Bears are simply too OP. Sloth bears from the Indian subcontinent are my favorite because of how aggressive they are.  Sloth bears view humans as potential predators, as their reactions to them are similar to those evoked in the presence of tigers and leopards. Their long claws, which are ideally adapted for digging at termite mounds, make adults less capable of climbing trees to escape danger, as are other bears such as Asian black bears. Therefore, sloth bears have seemingly evolved to deal with threats by behaving aggressively. \\n\\nWalmart was founded by brothers Sam and James \"Bud\" Walton in nearby Rogers, Arkansas in 1962 and incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law on October 31, 1969.

However, we will not always be able to get videos from a location unless that data is available in the video. To remove duplicates when running the code, I'll add a set that will store the video ID. Add the video ID to the set, and when going to next video check to make sure it hasn't been added yet so our pdf doesn't grow to large. "
